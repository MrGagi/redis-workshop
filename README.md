# Redis Workshop

This repository contains workshop for redis, only that you need to use to run everything is docker.
Every folder have it's own docekr-compose file which is used for running the app.

## Run the app

There is a **solution** branch which contains all working examples. If you checkout there you can run
```
docker-compose up
```
and see the working examples.

But, to work on workshop there is a readme file in every folder that explains what we are going to build and
which folders are most important for you to check. When you open exercise you can run command from above and project
will start with redis and node instance.
